# IncubyteFullStackAssessment
Repo for Incubyte Full Stack Assessment Test
This repo implements the "String Calculator" Kata using TDD, which can be found here ---> https://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1 
Following is the project structure:-
  1. Instructions.txt: contains all the tasks which are to be implemented.
  2. StringCalculator.java: implements string addition using add(String) method.
  3. StringCalculatorTest.java: contains test-cases based on which the code was generated using TDD.

Apart from this, below is the detail of tech stack which was used:-
  1. Java (12.0.1)
  2. JUnit (5.7.0)
  3. IntelliJ IDEA (2021.2)
  4. Git (2.21.0.windows.1)

The driving force was to write a proper, functioning code which is readable and also self-explanatory.
Would appreciate inputs & suggestions.
